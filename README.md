Our application, named WR MK8DX, is a Discord bot designed to provide users with detailed information about world records in various tracks from the game Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. The bot sends this information in an embed format, making it easy for users to view and interact with the data.

Key Features:
Player's Profile: The embed includes a section that displays the player's profile, providing a quick overview of the record holder.

Modes - 150cc and 200cc: The bot supports both 150cc and 200cc modes, allowing users to switch between them using a button that edits the embed. This makes it easy to compare records in different game modes.

Track Information: Each embed contains the name of the track where the record was set.

Recorded Time: The bot displays the exact time recorded for the world record, giving users precise information about the achievement.

Player's In-Game Name: The in-game name of the player who set the record is included in the embed, providing context and recognition.

Country: The embed shows the country of the record holder, adding a geographical context to the record.

Record Holding Duration: The bot includes information on how long the record has been held, highlighting the longevity of the achievement.

Lap Times (Lap1-3): Detailed lap times for each of the three laps are provided, allowing users to see the consistency and performance of the player.

Coins Collected per Lap: Information about the number of coins collected in each lap is included, which is an important aspect of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe gameplay.

Player's Combo: The embed details the combo used by the player, including kart, glider, character, and roll, offering insights into the strategy used to set the record.

Supporting Image from YouTube Video: An image related to the record, sourced from a YouTube video, is included to give a visual representation.
